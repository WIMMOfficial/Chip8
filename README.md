Chip8
=============================

WHAT IS IT?
------------
Pretty simple implementation of Chip8
You shouldn't use the emulator for playing because it's an educational project and there are may be some bugs
I made it just to figure out how this game console works from the inside 


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
CPU: Faster than potato
- GPU: Any
- OS: Linux
- RAM: 128Mb
- Also you'll need SDL2 library


HOW TO USAGE:
-------------
      $ ./chip8 -s [scale] -d [path to file]
